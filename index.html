<h1>Our Menu</h1>

<div class=chicken>
<h2> Chicken</h2>
<p>
	There is an invention called a “chicken gun” which is used to test the resistance of airplane windows and engines by blasting dead chickens at the aircraft.

<div class=beef>
	<h2>Beef</h2>
<	p>
	Mince accounts for almost 40% of beef production (this varies by country). Much of this goes into hamburgers. (We like to think that ours at Meat Online are right up there with the best!)

</div>

<div class=sushi>
	<h2>Sushi</h2>
	<p>
		Once upon a time, sushi didn't require a platinum credit card to enjoy. Sushi caught on originally as a cheap, quick snack to eat with the hands while enjoying a theater performance. Forget the popcorn: pass the sushi!
